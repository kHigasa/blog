- Music<br>Even though I don't usually like listening to music, I have some preference.<br>

    ***"Would you listen to euphoric songs for the broken hearted or dirty voice's rap music which doesn't make any sense at all??? I would rather stare at white ceiling and count the dust dropped from it."*** (~~In my view, there are many such songs in J-Pop, so I hate listening to J-pop.~~)
