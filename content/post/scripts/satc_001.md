# 001 *Sex and the City*

**Carrie:** Once upon a time, an English journalist came to NewYork.

**&nbsp;&nbsp;〃&nbsp;&nbsp;:** Elizabeth was attractive and bright. And right away, she hooked up with one of the city's typically eligible bachelors.

**Tim:** The question remains: Is this really a company we want to own?

**Carrie:** Tim was 42. A well-liked and respected investment banker who made about 2 million a year.

**&nbsp;&nbsp;〃&nbsp;&nbsp;:** They met one evening in typical New York fashion at a gallery opening.

**Tim:** Like it?

**Elizabeth:** Yes, actually. I think it's quite interesting. What?

**Tim:** I feel like I know you from somewhere.

**Elizabeth:** Doubtful. I only just moved here from London.

**Tim:** London, really? That's my all time favorite city.

**Elizabeth:** Oh, it is?

**Tim:** Absolutely.

**Carrie:** It was love at first sight.

**Elizabeth:** You know. I think perhaps I have met you somewhere before.

**Carrie:** For 2 weeks, they snuggled. ...went to romantic restaurants...had wonderful sex, and shared their most intimate secrets.

**&nbsp;&nbsp;〃&nbsp;&nbsp;:** One warm spring day, he took her to a town house he saw in Sunday's New York Times.

**A realtor:** How about if we start at the top and work our way down? There are 4 bedrooms upstairs. Do you have any children?

**Tim:** Not yet.

**Carrie:** That day, Tim popped the question.

**Tim:** How would you like to have dinner with my folks Tuesday night?

**Elizabeth:** I'd love to!

**Carrie:** On Tuesday he called with some bad news.

**Tim:** My mother's not feeling very well.

**Elizabeth:** Well gosh! I'm sorry...

**Tim:** Could we take a raincheck?

**Elizabeth:** Of course. Tell your mom I hope she feels better.

**Carrie:** When she hadn't heard from him for 2 weeks she called:

**Elizabeth:** Tim, its Elizabeth, that’s an awfully long rain check! 

**Carrie:** He said he was up to his ears and that he’d call her the next day.

**Elizabeth:** He never did call of course. Bastard.

**Carrie:** She told me one day over coffee.

**Elizabeth:** I don’t understand. In England, looking at houses together would have meant something.

**Carrie:** Then I realised no one had told her about the end of love in Manhattan.


**Tim:** 
**Carrie:** 
**Elizabeth:**
