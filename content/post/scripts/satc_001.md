# 001 *Sex and the City*

**Carrie:** Once upon a time, an English journalist came to NewYork.

**&nbsp;&nbsp;〃&nbsp;&nbsp;:** Elizabeth was attractive and bright. And right away, she hooked up with one of the city's typically eligible bachelors.

**Tim:** The question remains: Is this really a company we want to own?

**Carrie:** Tim was 42. A well-liked and respected investment banker who made about 2 million a year.

**&nbsp;&nbsp;〃&nbsp;&nbsp;:** They met one evening in typical New York fashion at a gallery opening.

**Tim:** Like it?

**Elizabeth:** Yes, actually. I think it's quite interesting. What?

**Tim:** I feel like I know you from somewhere.

**Elizabeth:** Doubtful. I only just moved here from London.

**Tim:** London, really? That's my all time favorite city.

**Elizabeth:** Oh, it is?

**Tim:** Absolutely.

**Carrie:** It was love at first sight.

**Elizabeth:** You know. I think perhaps I have met you somewhere before.

**Carrie:** For 2 weeks, they snuggled. ...went to romantic restaurants...had wonderful sex, and shared their most intimate secrets.

**&nbsp;&nbsp;〃&nbsp;&nbsp;:** One warm spring day, he took her to a town house he saw in Sunday's New York Times.

**A realtor:** How about if we start at the top and work our way down? There are 4 bedrooms upstairs. Do you have any children?

**Tim:** Not yet.

**Carrie:** That day, Tim popped the question.
