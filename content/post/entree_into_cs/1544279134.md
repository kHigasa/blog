In one of kernel memory allocating strategies, we use ***slab***. Kernel objects are allocated to the *cache*, which are initially marked as **free**.
A cache is allocated to slab. And a slab is made up of one ore more physically contiguous pages. An object is assigned from the cache, which is marked as **used**.

The slab strategy make mainly two benefits :)
1.Memory is not wasted by fragmentation since it returns the exact amount of memory required.
1.Memory allocations can be satisfied quickly. 

Furthermore, in the Linux kernel distribution, two other kernel memory allocations are now adopted--**SLOB** and **SLUB**.

SLAB, SLUB and SLOB ðŸ‘»
