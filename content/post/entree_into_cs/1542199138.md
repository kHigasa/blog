`ps aux | grep jenkins`

I'm familiar with this type of symbol, "**|**". Yes, this is so-called pipe. I understood so far this just what is named pipe.
However, this my thought is ambiguous a little. Today, I understood it clearly.

Pipes is a one of strategies of communication in client-server system(btw, the other two strategies are sockets and remote procedure calls(RPCs)).
For example, the *ps* command which serves as producer outputs processes and the output is consumed by the *grep* command.
(This ordinary pipes shows unidirectional, one-way communication and parent-child relationship.)


That is, pipes expressed on cli is **|**. :)
