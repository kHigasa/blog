***Semaphore*** is simply the methodology for processes to synchronize their activities.
Here, I'll look at its implements in python and erlang. Btw, why are these two lang? That's because not only I like them but also these have mechanism similar to the monitor, which is the methodology of synchronization implemented in high-level languages.
Then I remembered python implemented semaphore, and I had some interest with it erlang at first :)

**Erlang**

That just uses the semaphore implemented in c to implement other logics like [this](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/d6285b0a347b9489ce939511ee9a979acd868f71/erts/etc/win32/erlsrv/erlsrv_interactive.c#L1249).

`if ((lock_semaphore = CreateSemaphore(&attr, 1, 1, ERLSRV_INTERACTIVE_GLOBAL_SEMAPHORE)) == NULL) {
     return -1;
}`

**Python**

Implement [here](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c9b3fc6b59b625c36c31ad437253e7140938af1a/Lib/asyncio/locks.py#L410).

`class Semaphore(_ContextManagerMixin):`

hmhm..
This is the very semaphore logicüëç I highly recommend to see this script when you learn about semaphore.
