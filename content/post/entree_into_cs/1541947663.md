OS makes many system calls even if so simple programs are executed.
However, our programmer is never conscious of that. Why?? :(

It's typically due to the presence of ***API***, such as **Windows API**, **Java API** and so on. We always interact with him.

That is, the functions that make up an API typically invoke the actual system call on behalf of us.

Furthermore, most programming languages' run-time support system provides a ***system-call interface*** that serves as the link
to system calls.

Thus, by creating what operates what operates something, we can manage anything wellðŸ¤”
