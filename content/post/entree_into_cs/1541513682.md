Clustered systems are composed of nodes(individual systems) which respectively have single or multiprocessor, multicore systems.
And, such nodes are **loosely coupled**, which means they are interconnected by LAN, WAN etc, finally gather into storage area network, but separated.

This is the meaning of the OS.

Looking back on my software life, however, I have heard this word such as ***clustering***, ***cluster*** many times ever.(In actual, sometimes not many timesðŸ˜‚)
So, in the network infrastructure context, they are used!! The systems `docker swarm`, `k8s` express almost the same thing maybeðŸ¤”(I can't say this positively though I don't know well about this area :( ).

In the different area, the clustering concept is applied. So, cool :)
