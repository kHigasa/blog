I studied kernel data structure's overview today. At that time, I encountered this type of symbol, *O(n)* , *O(log n)* etc.
Its sym is familiar with me. So, it is the ***landau symbol***!!ðŸ˜‚ I firstly looked it on a mathematical analysis class.
It represents valuation of func, which, eventually, is **order**, and is often written in *O-*.

Someway, this sym is often used in the areas of computational theory, algorithm analysis and cryptography to evaluate their executing time.
OK, I see. So far so good. :)
