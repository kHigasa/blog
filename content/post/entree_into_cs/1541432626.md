# I/O device, what the heck is it??

In a paragraph.

> How, then, can we define what an operating system is? In general, we have no completely adequate definition of an operating system.
[OPERATING SYSTEM CONCEPTS](http://iips.icci.edu.iq/images/exam/Abraham-Silberschatz-Operating-System-Concepts---9th2012.12.pdf)

hmhm

>  Operating systems exist because they offer a reasonable way to solve the problem of creating a usable computing system.
The fundamental goal of computer systems is to execute user programs and to make solving user problems easier.
Computer hardware is constructed toward this goal.

> [...]. These programs require certain common operations, such as those controlling the I/O devices.
The common functions of *controlling* and *allocating* resources are then brought together into one piece of software: ***the operating system***.

I/O devices... :( I have heard this word, I/O, so often in the area of software(such as `STDIO` , `IO::` ,etc...)
But I don't know the I/O devises which the OS controls at all. What the heck is it??

> Examples of input/output devices
[Input/output device](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/iodevice.htm)

- CD-R/RW, DVD, and Blu-ray drive
- Digital camera
- Floppy diskette drive
- Hard drives
- Modem
- Network adapter
- SD Card
- Touch screen
- USB thumb drives

Oh, really?? They indicate input/output-ed devices not do-input/output devices, aren't they??
gotcha!!😂

This is my cs level, just now...haha lol

**Go ahead steadily** 👍
